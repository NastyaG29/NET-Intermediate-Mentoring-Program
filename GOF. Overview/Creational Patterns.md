## Creational patterns: definitions, problem and solution statements
## Test:

**1. What is the best definition of Creational patterns?**

游댮 A. This type of patterns provides a way to create interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
游릭 **B. This type of patterns provides an ability to hide creation logic instead of using new operator.**
游댮 C. This type of patterns is specifically concerned with communication between objects.
游댮 D. This type of patterns is specifically concerned with the presentation tier.

**2. What is related to Creational patterns? Multiple options available.**

游댮 A. Creational patterns are concerned with how objects and classes communicate with each other.
游릭 **B. Creational patterns hide how instances of classes are created and put together.**
游댮 C. Creational patterns describe ways to compose objects to realize new functionality.
游댮 D. Creational patterns show ways how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
游릭**E. Creational patterns encapsulate knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses.**

**3. What from the following code issues can be solved with Creational Patterns? Multiple answers possible.**

游댮 A. Algorithm implementation contains too many special case logic and conditional statements. 
游릭B. Different methods in subclass do semantically similar steps except for creating objects.
游릭**C. Creation code is duplicated in different methods.**
游댮 D. Class has new responsibility which is additional to its base responsibility which makes the class very big.
游릭**E. Creation logic is sprawled among many classes.** 
游댮 F. Classes implement the same of similar steps and have different interface which make client code complicated, since it has to work with both interfaces. 

**4. Which of the following pattern creates object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface?**

游릭 **A. Factory Pattern.**
游댮 B. Abstract Factory Pattern.
游댮 C. Singleton Pattern.
游댮 D. Prototype Pattern.

**5. Which of the following describes the Abstract Factory pattern correctly?**

游댮 A. This pattern creates object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.
游릭 **B. In this pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes.**
游댮 C. This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created.

**6. Which Design Pattern should you use when a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates?**
   
游댮 A. Abstract Factory. 
游댮 B. Builder.
游릭 **C. Factory Method.**
游댮 D. Singleton.

**7. Which Design Pattern should you use when there must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point.**
   
游댮 A. Abstract Factory. 
游댮 B. Builder.
游댮 C. Factory Method. 
游릭 **D. Singleton.**

**8. Which Design Pattern should you use when a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.**
游댮 A. Builder.
游릭 **B. Abstract Factory.**
游댮 C. Factory Method.
游댮 D. Singleton.
